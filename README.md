# KaseiCoin

KaseiCoin a new cryptocurrency developed to be used by the first human colony on MARS. This new monetary system, for the new Mars colony, is based on blockchain technology.

# Usage

KaseiCoin is a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that can be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

To accomplish this 3 contracts have been created:

* KaseiCoin token contract
* KaseiCoin crowdsale contract
* KaseiCoin deployer contract

Pre-production testing of the crowdsale was perfomed by deploying the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
